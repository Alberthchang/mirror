{"name":"Mirror","tagline":"sync program for mirror site","body":"# Mirror\r\n\r\n`Mirror` is an open source python application for mirror site (e.g. [mirror.bjtu.edu.cn](http://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn)) to sync files from upstreams (it uses rsync internally), it actually works like a cron, but has some differences. It has been served for mirror.bjtu.edu.cn with more than 40 rsync tasks.\r\n\r\nYou are welcome to send comments, patches and any others to [github](https://github.com/ideal/mirror/issues) or to [@idealities](http://twitter.com/idealities).\r\n\r\nHomepage: http://mirror.bjtu.edu.cn\r\n\r\nAuthors\r\n=======\r\n\r\n* Shang Yuanchun\r\n* Bob Gao\r\n\r\nFor contributors and past developers see: \r\n    AUTHORS\r\n\r\nInstallation Instructions\r\n=========================\r\n\r\nBuild and install by running:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython setup.py build\r\nsudo python setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr to a custom directory:\r\n```\r\nsudo python setup.py install --root=/tmp\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that, you are going to set up environment, you are encouraged to add a specific user to run `mirrord`, here we suppose the username is `mirror` and its home directory is `/home/mirror`.\r\n\r\nMake necessary directories:\r\n```sh\r\nsudo mkdir /var/log/mirrord /var/log/rsync\r\nsudo chown mirror:mirror /var/log/mirrord /var/log/rsync\r\nmkdir ~/.config/mirror\r\ncp config/mirror.ini ~/.config/mirror/\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can edit mirror.ini to fit your needs and run:\r\n```\r\nmirrord\r\n```\r\nand that's done. Also you can use `man mirrord` to read documents.\r\n\r\nAlso a command `mirror` is provided, if `mirrord` is running, you can run:\r\n```\r\nmirror -l\r\n```\r\nto show the current task queue.\r\n\r\nContact/Support\r\n===============\r\n\r\nEmail: idealities@gmail.com\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n========\r\n\r\n * It's simple and easy to add a mirror\r\n * You can set a priorty for each mirror, from 1 to 10, 1 is highest\r\n * And scheduler will schedule a task depending on current conditions\r\n * You can also set a timeout for each mirror\r\n * Support for two stage syncing (for ubuntu, debian)\r\n * You can also use it as another cron...\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
